# StarWars Fan Website

A small, themed front-end project featuring two interactive JavaScript mini-apps wrapped in a simple dark-mode site. I developed this project during my first college course in Web Development. This project incorporates a mixture of HTML, CSS, and Javascript into one elegant website. 

## DISCLAIMER
A strong recommendation for this project is to use a desktop computer or laptop to view the website, as the mobile portion of the website has not been optimized at the current state.

## Overview
- **Homepage (`index.html`)** links to two projects:
  - **Heroes vs. Villains**: pick a hero and a villain to see who wins based on power levels.
  - **Galactic Temperature Converter**: convert °C ↔ °F with Star Wars-themed feedback.
 
## Installation
1. Download or clone the project from this repository's provided .zip file (Starwars Fan Website.zip).
2. Open `CPSC280 Website Project/index.html` in any modern browser.

## Build
No build required. Static HTML/CSS/JS only.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)

## Features
- ES6 classes & inheritance for character logic (`Game1.js`)
- Input validation and live field clearing in the converter (`Game2.js`)
- Single stylesheet with a clean dark theme (`Web1CSS.css`)
- Lightweight, no frameworks
